# Aerial Landscape Image Classification using machine learning techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks

### üìå Overview
This project aims to classify aerial images into 15 landscape categories (e.g., Airport, Beach, City, Forest, etc.). Machine learning covers data loading and preprocessing, feature extraction using **LBP** and **SIFT**, and model training and evaluation with various classifiers. using convolutional neural networks using **EfficientNet-B0** and **ResNet18**. We applied **5-fold cross-validation**, **data augmentation**, and evaluated performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrix** visualizations.

## üìö Code References

This project leverages the following open-source resources:

- [PyTorch Official Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- `torchvision` pretrained models and datasets: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html (models.efficientnet_b0, models.resnet18Ôºâ)
- Scikit-learn's classification metrics and cross-validation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.model_selection


### Machine Learning
## Data Processing

The image data is loaded using `keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` to create training and validation datasets. The images are resized to 256x256 pixels.

The `extract_images_labels` function is used to extract the images and labels from the TensorFlow datasets into NumPy arrays.

## Feature Extraction

Two feature extraction methods are employed:

* **LBP (Local Binary Pattern):** The `extract_lbp_features` function calculates LBP features for the images.
* **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):** The `extract_sift_features` function calculates SIFT features.

## Model description

The following machine learning models are used for classification:

* **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** Basic and weighted versions.
* **Random Forest:** Basic and weighted versions.
* **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** Basic and weighted versions using SGDClassifier.

Weighted models are implemented to address potential class imbalance in the dataset. Class weights are calculated using `sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_class_weight`.

## Model Evaluation

The `evaluate_model` function is used to train and evaluate each model. It reports:

* Training time
* Prediction time
* Overall accuracy
* Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) for each class
* Confusion matrix visualization

## how to run

1.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
2.  Download the Aerial Landscapes dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the appropriate directory.
3.  Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the data loading, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Results

The notebook provides a comprehensive evaluation of different feature extraction and classification model combinations for the landscape classification task. The results, including accuracy and confusion matrices, are presented to compare the performance of each approach.
